%I am currently a psychometrician at the Center for Applied Linguistics with \textbf{3 years of experience}. During my time here I have led a team of quantitative researchers on all psychometric analyses and have worked together with other test development teams to publish several English language tests administered both in the United States and abroad. In addition, I have \textbf{6 years of experience working in the academic setting}, mainly testing, teaching and writing about statistical and psychometric models. Over the years I have developed a passion for analyzing and drawing inferences from test data, as well as developing valid, reliable, and fair assessment tools.
