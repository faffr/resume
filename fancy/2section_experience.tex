      \begin{itemize}

            \item Led the quantitative research team to execute analyses like equating, item calibration, and standard setting for successful submission to the Office of Career and Technical Education for approval of a computer-adaptive speaking, reading, and writing test
      
            \item Developed an R script to automatically configure and execute a test classification accuracy software for 192 different samples of approximately 8,000 students, reducing overall analysis time by 80\%
            
            \item Provided statistical consulting for a study (N = 15,000) examining differences in English language learner sub-populations, resulting in statistically sound methods applied for submission to a large state agency

      \begin{itemize}

          \item Collaborated with the test development team and conducted all quantitative analyses for publication of CAL-EPT test in Mexico, giving approximately 8,000 secondary students access to a reliable and valid English language test since FY 2018
          
          \item Simulated examinee polytomously scored responses to create distributions of possible scores, which served as the main methodology for deciding on the optimal routing criteria for a paper-based version of a multi-stage computer-adaptive test 
          
          \item Built a data reshaping package and created a user-friendly procedure to help non-quantitative team members clean messy data in approximately 15 minutes, reducing process time by 75\%
          
          \item Developed an R script to automatically configure and execute item calibration software for 80 different subset of items, reducing analysis time by 80\%

      \begin{itemize}
            \item Created an R package to conduct item bias analysis (DIF) for use specifically with multi-stage adaptive tests, allowing for the continued delivery of crucial item statistics to one of our major clients
            
           \item Developed an R function to identify the combinations of routes taken by examinees taking a multi-stage adaptive test for reading and listening, providing important ancillary information to help decide how item reliability measures for multi-stage adaptive tests should be calculated
